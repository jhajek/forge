## Back to Blogging

Well after taking some time off and having baby number 4, (Hello to baby Lily), I decided to return to blogging to put down all of the activities and observations regarding the various tech stacks I am working with and teaching on.

This blog happens to be a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll Homepage") blog. I liked the idea of projects like Jekyll and am using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/ "Markdown guide website link") exclusively for writing and markup. Just text -- which is the true universal format. Using markdown is very liberating as I can work anywhere in any system.  All of the code is stored in GitHub and is rendered by a simple ruby application (Jekyll) by a single command into static HTML.  As reflected in the Jekyll mantra:

* Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs
* No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to installâ€”just your content
* Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment

I recommend giving it a try!
