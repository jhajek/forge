<p>While trying to setup an account on Microsoft Outlook 2010, I was able to connect to the mail server; however, I came across an authentication issue with the credentials I used for the username and password. I knew the username and password were correct, but I kept getting that error message.</p>
<p>The solution was to put in the â”¬&aacute;fqdn after the the username. (example: user01@myglobalcompany.com instead of just user01)</p>
