<p><strong>PHP - impress.js designer</strong></p>
<p>  Project involves using the s5 project as a basis and reimplementing this solution using impresss.js  a javascript library allowing us to integrate Powerpoint like slides with CSS/JS/HTML5 transformations   - this is currently in use at the Rice Campus but we want to redeploy and then open source this code.</p>
<p><strong>PHP/ASP.NET/Python front End for Rsyslog System</strong></p>
<p>   We are looking two volunteers.  1 to develop an front end (web based) in any language and a second developer to develop SQL queries to pull report data from a mysql database .</p>
<p><strong>Front End developer for interface with Amazon SimpleDB </strong></p>
<p>   Similiar fashion as above we need someone to help develop and internal ticket system for the department using Amazon SimpleDB - you will get experience working with Amazon API's and cloud based storage</p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu MAAS - Metal as a Service</strong></p>
<p>  This is a real exciting project as Ubuntu has created a service MAAS along with JuJu for deploying software on ready and waiting servers preconfigured.   This is really the future of software on any scale being deployed. </p>
<p>Please contact hajek@hawk.iit.edu if you are interested in any projects.</p>
