<p>Here are the honest answers of a linux convert.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been using Linux as a desktop?<br />
</strong><br />
I tried Linux around 2005 with Ubuntu 5.10 and some version of Knoppix that my friend Dave gave me. We would boot up and look around, but we quickly realized it was a work in progress and we couldn&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;t get much real work done yet. It didn&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;t really pick up for me until Ubuntu 8.04 when wireless started to work. Vista came out after that and I got a laptop that happened to be nearly impossible to downgrade to XP. I was able to make it work with Ubuntu and it&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;s been around ever since. I&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;ve used Linux for everything but Industrial Design. I use a Mac a lot these days because my job requires it, Adobe CS works and as of 10.5 it is sufficiently Unixy and Posix compliant. I keep all three around. I think it is important to know all of them.</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages you have found?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to servers there is no replacement for Linux. It runs on everything. It&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;s fast. I&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;ve used linux to extend the life of older<br />
hardware many times. I&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;ve had friends bring me laptops that just<br />
wouldn&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;t run windows anymore, trackpads and keyboards on laptops are a common one. But, I installed Ubuntu and it works. They were able to<br />
get six months or a year out of the machine so they could save some<br />
money for a new computer. Linux is a Unix like system so Malware is in short supply. After the debacles of Raw sockets in XP, and Vista being unusable I am very cautious about any MS stuff I use. For some<br />
applications I don&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the disadvantages you first encountered - what are<br />
some of them now?<br />
</strong><br />
At that time I started it (Ubuntu 5.10-7.04) was still very raw and a<br />
lot of important packages had to be built from source. Most basic<br />
Ethernet adapters would work, but you could forget about wireless card support except for a select few. The best thing to do was buy a used kernel supported wifi card off of ebay for 20 bucks. Open up the<br />
machine and put in, and sell the other to get back your money. You<br />
could forget about any type of flash or hd video working on a fresh<br />
install. Ubuntu was constantly breaking sound. It got to the point<br />
were I just turned updates off. I would get my computer working the<br />
way I liked and clone it.</p>
<p>The important 3D Design packages like Solidworks and Creo (formerly<br />
Pro/ENGINEER) don&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;t even run on anything else but windows. Adobe CS<br />
doesn&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;t really run on Linux either. I&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;ve installed Photoshop with wine several times and it was kind of a ridiculous process.</p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage now is Unity and Gnome 3. I feel they force<br />
you to use them in a rather narrow way. I&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;ve been using Kubuntu since<br />
Ubuntu started shipping with Unity. I&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;m going to try Unity again when<br />
the first dot update for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is released.</p>
<p><strong>What should someone who is about to make the switch consider?<br />
</strong><br />
Buy good hardware. I see people on the Ubuntu forums complaining that<br />
their $300 laptop that barely runs windows isn&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;t working right with<br />
Linux. There is an old saying, &Gamma;&Ccedil;&pound;only a rich man can afford cheap<br />
tools&Gamma;&Ccedil;&yen;. It&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;s correct. Your much better off buying a 18 months old off<br />
lease Enterprise grade laptop from ebay that a cheapo consumer model<br />
on clearance at Best Buy. I&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;ve wasted more of my life screwing around<br />
trying to make cheap junk work than I care to remember. Time is money, if something doesn&Gamma;&Ccedil;&Ouml;t work right new it probably never will. Get rid of it.</p>
<p>Other than that consider your use case. If you really want Adobe to<br />
work right and you earn your dollars with it, Linux is not going to<br />
make you happy. If you really want to pay video games same story. If<br />
you want to learn to program or configure servers then dual boot and<br />
use Linux and the terminal as much as possible and learn Unix by<br />
immersion. Clone your install, break it, fix it and repeat. People who know Unix will always have more employment options.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you pick the flavor of linux that you did?</strong></p>
<p>Ubuntu and CentOS picked me. Use whatever works for you.</p>
