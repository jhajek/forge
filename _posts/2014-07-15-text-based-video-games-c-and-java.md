Long long ago, in a galaxy far far away (2008), a high school summer program at the <a href="http://web.iit.edu">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> - <a href="http://appliedtech.iit.edu/" title="SAT">School of Applied Technology</a> created some text based video games.   The code is pretty spaghetti but remarkably it works - think of it as a platform for tinkering.
The first project was done in C++.  You can open the project in any version of Visual Studio or just run the game from the DEBUG directory double clicking the Test.exe file.

The second project is a java based version of the game - a little cleaner code but still not really any game play.  It is a <a href="https://netbeans.org/" title="netbeans">Netbeans</a> project and can be opened and run with any Netbeans - just hit File > Open Project and then the green "run" triangle and you are off.<br />

What would these games look like in Python?
