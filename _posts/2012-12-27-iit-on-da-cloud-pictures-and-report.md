<p>On November 5,6, and 7th of this year the School of Applied Technology at IIT and the <a href="http://itmo.drupalgardens.com/" title="ITMO">ITMO group</a> launched a cloud computing competition where we ran students through a complete install of <a href="http://www.eucalyptus.com/" title="http://www.eucalyptus.com/">Eucalyptus 3.1.2</a> as well as deployment of ISO images and small application development with Walrus, <a href="http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" title="Jets3t library for connecting to Walrus">JetS3t</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/typica/" title="Typica Cloud Compting Library">Typica</a>. </p>
<p>Here is a review of the event: <a href='https://blog.sat.iit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Review_of_ITMOs_IITonDaCloud.pdf'>Review_of_ITMOs_IITonDaCloud.pdf</a></p>
