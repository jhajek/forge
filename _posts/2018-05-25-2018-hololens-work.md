This is a small smaple of the work we have done at [Illinois Tech](https://web.iit.edu "IIT URL"), [School of Applied Technology](https://appliedtech.iit.edu/ "SAT") in relation to large scale immerseive holograms (**LSIH**).   The work has definately evolved as we have learned the nature of the platform.
