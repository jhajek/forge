<p>Hi 1871 Universities,</p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that we are beginning the internship hiring process for 1871 startups!</p>

Many are interested in hiring interns for the summer in a variety of functions, from software engineers to marketers to writers, business analysts to sales! Many of the internships will be paid (at startup rates) and will typically run for 8-12 weeks during the summer, with exact dates to vary by startup.</p>
<p>We would appreciate if you can share this with your current students seeking internships.</p>
