Thanks to all the hard work of the students in ITMT 492/593.   This is a class where we focus on creating Embedded Systems, "Smart Device Technology" prototypes.  We are solving and creating real devices here.   I would also like to thank Dr. Dan Tomal for his help in co-teaching.    If you like what you see and want to join in - all departments are welcome.
