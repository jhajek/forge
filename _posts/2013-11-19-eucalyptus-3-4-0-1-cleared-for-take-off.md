<p>Dear Cloud Friends,</p>
<p>   How are you?  I am pleased to announce that the SAT ITM Eucalyptus Cloud is back online and open for business.   </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sat.iit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/eucalyptus-logo-349x83.png"><img src="https://blog.sat.iit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/eucalyptus-logo-349x83-300x71.png" alt="eucalyptus-logo-349x83" width="300" height="71" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1007" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.eucalyptus.com">Eucalyptus.com</a></p>
<p>How can you access it?   Good question - <a href="https://64.131.111.112:8443">https://64.131.111.112:8443</a>  and click SIGNUP for a new account.  (yes it is a self-signed cert but that will be taken care off soon.)   </p>
<p>The purpose of this cloud is to provide elastic resources to projects and researchers needing it.   I envision our department going to Applied Math, Psycology, even Business and collaborating together.  Also if you as a student have a great idea and need some resources to prototype ideas - then this is the place.</p>
<p>Detailed tutorial to follow.</p>
<p>take care</p>
