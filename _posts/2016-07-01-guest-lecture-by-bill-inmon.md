Thanks to my good friend professor [Bill Slater](http://www.billslater.com/ "Bill Slater"), I was able to attend a guest lecture by Bill Inmon last night on the topic of [data lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake "data lakes").

**Who is Bill Inmon?**

[Bill Inmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Inmon "Who is Bill Inmon?")
William H. Inmon (born 1945) is an American computer scientist, recognized by many as the father of the data warehouse. Bill Inmon wrote the first book, held the first conference (with Arnie Barnett), wrote the first column in a magazine and was the first to offer classes in data warehousing. Inmon created the accepted definition of what a data warehouse is - a subject oriented, nonvolatile, integrated, time variant collection of data in support of management's decisions. Compared with the approach of the other pioneering architect of data warehousing, Ralph Kimball, Inmon's approach is often characterized as a top-down approach.
