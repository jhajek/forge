![*Windows 10 Logo](https://forge.sat.iit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Windows-10-Logo-300x199.jpg  "Windows-10-Logo")

Hi - I have been using the Windows 10 Technical Preview since October of 2014.  It has definitely been a wild ride.  Some months were good - some were not so good.  But now Windows 10 is shaping up and runs very well on my [Fujitsu TH700 tablet](http://www.cnet.com/products/fujitsu-lifebook-th700-12-1-core-i3-350m-windows-7-home-premium-64-bit-4-gb-ram-320-gb-hdd/specs/)  (4+ years old) (Pre-dates [ultra-books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook))

I have lived with it in production - running Hyper-V and doing my daily work on it. No retreat and no VMs here. <del datetime="2015-07-06T19:07:26+00:00">Build 10158 is pretty solid.</del>

Build 10162 is really solid - not a single issue so far.

Take care,
World Class!
