<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>  I am typing this from a Viewsonic td2220 touch enabled monitor. I have taken the plunge into Windows 8.  I like the Metro style apps and hope to see more adoption.  But what I am interested in is can my workflow be significantly improved by adding touch capabilities to my desktop?  We all have tablets and phones - but can it work in the desktop?  Like anything staying focused and not quitting when you get frustrated is the key to understanding and learning this environment.  I would encourage anyone to try it.</p>
<p>Here is what I have learned so far.  dd</p>
<p>First to the concept of <em>"touch"</em> doesn't come out of the box for free - (boy did I feel dumb when I figured this out!)  When you connect your monitor via HDMI or DMI or VGA - that is just for video out - it has no way to send the touch data back to the PC!   There is a separate USB connector that handles this.  Basically the touch screen is treated as a monitor with a USB device embedded in it - but the device manager sees it as two things.</p>
<p>Once that was ready - the touching features worked - pinch- zoom- exactly what you would think.</p>

<p>  Then I realized that alt-tabing is a "desktop" way of thinking.  You swipe up or left edge in.  Ah technology. =)</p>
