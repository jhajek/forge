Dear Friends,

Went to an amazing DevOps meetup here in Chicago and heard [Bryan Cantrill](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/ "Bryan Cantrill") (CTO of Joyent) speak.  He is as advertised.  Also heard from Ray Krueger, the CTO of Hilton Hotels talk about their own IT and infrastructure patterns.  
They posted a video of the presentation here:

Go to about 1:40 (1 hour 40 minutes in) to hear me ask a question about debugging and tracings place in education.

I highly recommend [joining and attending](http://www.meetup.com/devops/?gj=wc1d.2_c&rv=wc1d.2_c "join and attend") the DevOps Chicago meetup: (free and they usually feed you)
