<p>The public beta for Windows 8 was released a few days ago.  Anyone can download it and use it for free.  Microsoft gets feedback and error reports and you get to see the new features and especially the new Metro interface.  I have already installed it - I have attached some screen shots.  The interface is a bit different -- for those old enough to remember think when we jumped from Windows 3.11 to Win 95 different. Back then there was a lot of hatred towards windows 95 interface but it grew on people.  We shall see.</p>
<p>The link for downloading the Beta is : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview?ocid=O_MSC_W8P_OandO_Consumer_EN-US" title="Windows 8 Consumer Preview Beta">Windows 8 Consumer Preview Beta</a>  Also the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/" title="Windows 8 blog">Windows 8 blog</a> is well worth your time to read.[gallery]</p>
