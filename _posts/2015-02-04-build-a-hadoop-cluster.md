<p>Professor Jeremy Hajek and a couple of us are working on a project in which deploying hadoop clusters is a module. We have a set of shell scripts which can do this job and would like to share them to all. Follow the github link below</p>

<p>Feel free to post any issues you might encounter on the github page.</p>
