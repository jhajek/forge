I am working with Ganglia setting it up.  I was searching for the right syntax to auto-accept the apache2 restart prompt.  I couldn't quite come up with the right phrasing of the this situation...
After a while searching [askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com) and [serverfault](http://serverfault.com) I came across a good answer here: [http://serverfault.com/questions/423469/suppress-user-input-when-installing-ganglia-on-ubuntu](http://serverfault.com/questions/423469/suppress-user-input-when-installing-ganglia-on-ubuntu).

But Something looked familiar about the answer and the comments...

Yep...  that's me giving the comment clarifying an answer.  I don't know if this is a good sign that I did this and forgot about it or a bad omen that I found my own answer and forgot about it.
Perhaps there should be a specific stackoverflow badge for this...

take care
