<p>Good news our newly built and renovated Smart Tech and Embedded Systems Lab at <a href="http://web.iit.edu/">Illinois Tech</a> recently got an official sign and plaque outside the main door.  Like a country isn't official until it has a flag and an anthem, now we have a sign and are an official lab.</p>

Take care,
