<p>Hi - I have been using the Windows 10 Technical Preview since October of 2014.  It has definitely been a wild ride.  Some months were good - some were not so good.  But now Windows 10 is shaping up and runs very well on my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cnet.com&#47;products&#47;fujitsu-lifebook-th700-12-1-core-i3-350m-windows-7-home-premium-64-bit-4-gb-ram-320-gb-hdd&#47;specs&#47;">Fujitsu TH700 tablet<&#47;a> (4+ years old) (Pre-dates <a href="https:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Ultrabook">ultra-books<&#47;a>, ultra-book)  </p>
<p>I have lived with it in production - running Hyper-V and doing my daily work on it.   No retreat and no VMs here.  <del datetime="2015-07-06T19:07:26+00:00">Build 10158 is pretty solid.<&#47;del><br />
Build 10162 is really solid - not a single issue so far.</p>
<p>Screen Shot in action!</p>
