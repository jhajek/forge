<p>This was done in March of 2015 -- I forgot to post it so I am posting it now.  </p>
<p><strong>Fist successful flight of the Autonomous Service Framework<br />

<p>The voice you hear is then Undergraduate student Mark Milhouse --  completing this demo out in the February snow of 2015, near the IIT Keating Sports Center.</p>
<p>This is the first outtake video of our unit getting confused and dropping its payload mid-air</p>
<p>https:&#47;&#47;youtu.be&#47;PSdfGmEkUYA</p>
<p>Finally this last video is some funny out-takes of the units crashing, all set to music.</p>

<p>This was all the footage from our initial round of research.</p>
