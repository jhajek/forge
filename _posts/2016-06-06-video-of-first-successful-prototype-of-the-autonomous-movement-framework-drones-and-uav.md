**Fist successful flight of the Autonomous Service Framework**

*This was done in March of 2015 -- I forgot to post it so I am posting it now.*

The voice you hear is then Undergraduate student Mark Milhouse --  completing this demo out in the February snow of 2015, near the IIT Keating Sports Center.

This is the first outtake video of our unit getting confused and dropping its payload mid-air

Finally this last video is some funny out-takes of the units crashing, all set to music.

This was all the footage from our initial round of research.
