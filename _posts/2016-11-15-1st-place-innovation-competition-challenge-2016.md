IIT 1st Place Chicago Innovation Challenge winners include INTM undergraduate student Venika Jarvis (left) and Stuart graduate student Karen Castillo (right). Their product, Reveler, is a backpack for those with vision impairments or vision disabilities. Venika Jarvis states "when the user is wearing the backpack and it is turned on, sensors detect when a person or object is within proximity of the user. When products similar to Reveler are created that are assistive technology, it becomes so much more larger than the creators. It’s about enhancing the lifestyle of its user and trying to make their daily routines easier. Reveler is a product we believe can change how people look at the world.”
