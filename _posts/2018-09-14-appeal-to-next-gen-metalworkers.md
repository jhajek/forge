[MSC Direct](https://www.mscdirect.com "MSC Direct") produced this video at the recent IMTS 2018 trade show.

[IMTS 2018 VIDEO: Colleges, Companies Join Forces to Appeal to Next-Gen Metalworkers](https://www.mscdirect.com/betterMRO/imts-2018-video-colleges-companies-join-forces-appeal-next-gen-metalworkers "ITMS Video")

In the long term, manufacturing businesses know that to close the skills gap, they must expose high school and college students to the industryâ€™s emerging opportunities.

The burgeoning role of technology in metalworking jobs creates an entry point.

Learn how businesses and schools are working to create new education paths and introduce students to potential metalworking jobs, even in high school, at events like the IMTS Smartforce Student Summit.
Students get the chance to touch and feel the latest metalworking gear and manufacturing tech, as well as talk to colleges and businesses working to create new education and career paths.

Participants:

* Baker Gregory, Graduate Student, [Illinois Institute of Technology](Illinois Institute of Technology "INTM")
* Jeremy Hajek, Industry Associate Professor, IT and Management, [Illinois Institute of Technology](Illinois Institute of Technology "ITM")
* Derek Sporleder, Application Engineer, Mitutoyo
