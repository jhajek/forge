After you download bitnami package:

* Create a virtual machine on virtual box
* Choose existing hard disk
* Select the main vmdk(the one without s001.vmdk, s002.vmdk etc...)
* Set network configuration as bridged adapter
* Start the new vm you just made
* Log in, I believe user name and pass is bitnami then you are asked to change your password
* There will be an IP address displayed; put that into your browser and discourse will start up!
* Download link: <a href="http://bitnami.com/stack/discourse#version_1853"></a>
* Get started after installation: <a href="http://wiki.bitnami.com/Applications/BitNami_Discourse"></a>
