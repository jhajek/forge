Jeremy Hajek, Industry Associate Professor of Information Technology and Management in conjunction with Dr. Arjun Chakravarti
[Assistant Professor of Management and Marketing](https://stuart.iit.edu/faculty/arjun-chakravarti "Arjun Chakravarti") : The research project weâ€™re working on with Florida Atlantic University is a unique opportunity. The whole goal is to evaluate sea level rise in the Fort Lauderdale area, the community, and the impact it is going to have on commercial, residential. And the idea is to show the community what these impacts are going to be.
