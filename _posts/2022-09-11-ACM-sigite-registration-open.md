> SIGITE 2022 : The 23rd ACM Conference on Information Technology Education
September 21, 2022 – September 24, 2022
SIGITE provides a forum to discuss, develop, evolve, and promote the discipline of IT.

The academic discipline of IT is quite new but is now recognized by ACM as well as IEEE as a peer in the menu of computing disciplines along side computer science (CS), information systems (IS), and computer engineering (CE).

The SIG’s mission is thus twofold:

1. To be a venue for the discussion and dissemination of IT education.
1. To articulate, promote, and dissemination of research related to IT.

[Registration is open now!](https://web.cvent.com/event/b9c21171-379c-479d-8272-e10422dc36aa/summary "SIGITE registration webpage")
