### Apache Spark

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/ "Apache Spark WebPage") is a "Unified engine for large-scale data analytics."  Spark is technically the evolution of the [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org "Apache Hadoop WebSite") platform.

Spark generally started development and release as a product ~2012. It analyzed what Hadoop had done and the design decisions that had been made during its creation.
