For a while I wanted to publish the research capabilities of Cloud Lab research group in the [Information Technology and Management Program](http://iit.edu/itm "ITM") Program at the [College of Computing](https://www.iit.edu/computing "College of Computing").

## Current Hardware Platform

The first question I receive when talking about the Cloud Lab is something akin to, *"Why not just use AWS?"* And this is a fair question. Having an on-prem Cloud Infrastructure has benefits over AWS or Azure or other cloud platforms.  


My philiosphy of on-prem Cloud is explained in detail here


### Hardware and Software

So what can one use for on-prem cloud?

* [Git](https://git-scm.org "Git website")
* [Github](https://github.com "GitHub website")
* [Proxmox 7](https://proxmox.com "Proxmox website")
* [Packer](https://packer.io "Pacjer website")
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io "Terraform website")
* [Consul](https://consul.io "Consul website")
* TrueNas
